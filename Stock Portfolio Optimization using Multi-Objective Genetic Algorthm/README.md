# Stock Portfolio Optimization using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorthm [2024]

This project focuses on optimizing stock portfolios using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The main goal is to create an optimal balance between two competing objectives: maximizing returns while minimizing risk. The algorithm evolves a population of candidate portfolios, iteratively selecting, crossing, and mutating them based on fitness values that represent return and risk.

Each portfolio is evaluated based on historical stock data, calculating expected returns and risks using variance or standard deviation.
The algorithm not only returns an efficient solution, but an efficient frontier, offering investors a set of optimal portfolios that trade off risk and return effectively. The project also includes visual representations of portfolio performance and the efficient frontier, making it easier for investors to analyze their options and make informed decisions.
