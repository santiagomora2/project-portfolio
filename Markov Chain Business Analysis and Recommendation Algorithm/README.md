# Markov Chain Business Analysis and Recommendation Algorithm [2024]

This project aimed to model the activation and deactivation of product sales for Medicom, a pharmaceutical distributor, using Markov Chains. Sales data were analyzed to understand customer behavior, focusing on active and inactive states over time. The model helped determine sales patterns and customer lifetime value (CLV) using transition probabilities and recurrence times, providing business strategies and sales forecasting.

Additionaly, a recommendation system was built using cosine similarity to recommend products either based on a customer's shopping habits or on which materials are frequently bought together, to provide better strategies and recommendations for Medicom.

The data used for this project is not available as it is sensitive information from Medicom.
