# Feature Extraction & Logistic Regression - Violence Detection [2024]

Data was obtained from the publicly available ENDIREH survey (National Survey on the Dynamics of Relationships in Homes), which asks questions about domestic violence directed at women in Mexico. As this was a very large database, key questions were selected, and feature extraction methods were employed to identify the most important questions in the survey.

The objective was to create a shorter questionnaire powered by a logistic regression algorithm to use machine learning to detect potential domestic violence signs in Mexican homes. the most effective algorithm for both short and long distances.
