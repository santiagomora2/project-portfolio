# Linear Regression and Linear Programming for Pill Production Optimization [2024]

This project is centered on optimizing the production process of pharmaceutical pills using a combination of linear regression and linear programming techniques. Linear regression is employed to predict the values of hardness and friability of a pill based on parameters that can be changed through the programming of the pill-making machine. Linear Programming is used to, within an arbitrary range of each parameter, find the optimum values of each to maximize hardness and minimize friability.
