# Project Portfolio

A collection of the most relevant projects completed throughout my bachelor's degree.

As a Mexican student, all of these projects are written in Spanish, but any of them can be translated into English upon request.

Special thanks to the teachers and classmates who have helped me along the way.

Listed from the most recent to the oldest:

### Markov Chain Business Analysis and Recommendation Algorithm [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Markov%20Chain%20Business%20Analysis%20and%20Recommendation%20Algorithm) [2024]

- Product sales were analyzed to extract reactivation and deactivation probabilities and other metrics using Markov chains, along with a recommendation system using cosine similarity. Business insights were given based on this analysis. 

### Gaussian Bayesian Networks for Alzheimers Disease [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Gaussian%20Bayesian%20Networks%20for%20Alzheimers%20Disease) [2024]

- DAGs and Gaussian Bayesian Networks were used to study the relationship between Alzheimerâ€™s disease biomarkers and brain atrophy/cognitive decline, offering insights into disease progression and potential diagnostic tools.

### Bayesian Networks for Education in Mexico [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Bayesian%20Networks%20for%20Education%20in%20Mexico) [2024]

- Research on educational outcomes in Mexico through Bayesian networks, analyzing factors like gender, age, and school type. The findings highlight key dependencies influencing education and provide suggestions for policy improvements.

### Machine Learning (Unsupervised) for Fetal Potential Heart Disease Clustering [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20(unsupervised)%20for%20fetuses'%20potential%20heart%20disease%20clustering) [2024]

- Applied unsupervised learning to cluster fetal heart data, revealing potential early indicators of hypoxia.

### Machine Learning (Supervised) for Voice Recognition [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20(supervised)%20for%20voice%20recognition) [2024]

- Developed a real-time voice command classifier using SVM with Linear Kernel after comparing ten supervised learning algorithms.

### TSP (Linear Programming) - Route Optimization for an Enterprise [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/TSP%20(linear%20programming)%20-%20route%20optimization%20for%20an%20enterprise) [2024]

- Optimized promoter routes and transportation costs for an enterprise using a TSP model with linear programming.

### Local Search Algorithms - Robot on Mars [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Local%20search%20algorithms%20-%20robot%20in%20mars) [2024]

- Simulated a robot's descent into a Mars crater, finding Simulated Annealing more effective for global minima than Greedy Search.

### Complete Search Algorithms - Robot on Mars [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Complete%20search%20algorithms%20-%20%20robot%20in%20mars) [2024]

- Compared A*, Greedy, Breadth-First, and Depth-First algorithms for Mars robot navigation, with A* proving most effective.

### Feature Extraction & Logistic Regression - Violence Detection [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Feature%20exctraction%20%26%20logistic%20regression%20-%20violence%20detection) [2024]

- Used feature extraction and logistic regression to design a shorter survey for detecting domestic violence signs in Mexican homes.

### Differential Equations - Disease Evolution [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/Differential%20equations%20-%20disease%20evolution) [2023]

- Modeled disease spread using an SIR system, analyzing the effects of various parameters and vaccination on pandemic prevention.

### PCA for Dimensionality Reduction [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/PCA%20for%20dimensionality%20reduction) [2023]

- Demonstrated dimensionality reduction in facial image data using PCA, with a focus on variance retention.

### EDA - Music Data [(folder)](https://github.com/santiagomora2/project-portfolio/tree/main/EDA%20-%20music%20data) [2023]

- Conducted an EDA on Spotify data to identify key components influencing song popularity and their suitable probability distributions.
