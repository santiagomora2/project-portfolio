# Machine Learning (Unsupervised) for Fetal Potential Heart Disease Clustering [2024]

Unsupervised learning methods were applied to a Kaggle database on fetal heart disease. Three clustering methods were used: K-Means, Bisecting K-Means, and Gaussian Mixture Model. Their results were compared, with the variable fetal_health used as a label to evaluate how each algorithm clustered the data.

The most interesting result was that K-Means clustering identified two groups with different cardiotocography results, which, upon further investigation, were found to potentially be early indicators of hypoxia in fetuses.
