# Differential Equations - Disease Evolution [2023]

Systems of differential equations were used to model an SIR system (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered), simulating how a disease evolves over time within a population. Various coefficients were modified to analyze the model's behavior, such as the disease's contagiousness, recovery rate, and population's birth and death rates, among others. Additionally, vaccination was introduced to test its effectiveness in preventing a pandemic.
