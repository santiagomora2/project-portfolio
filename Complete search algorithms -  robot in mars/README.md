# Complete Search Algorithms - Robot on Mars [2024]

Complete search algorithms (A*, Greedy, Breadth-First, and Depth-First) were used to simulate an exploration robot on Mars, tasked with reaching a target coordinate set starting from an arbitrary coordinate set. Each pair of starting and target points was used in every algorithm to allow for a fair comparison, and both short and long distances were tested.

Upon comparison, A* was found to be the most effective algorithm for both short and long distances.
