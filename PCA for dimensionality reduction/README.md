# PCA for Dimensionality Reduction  [2023]

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used to illustrate dimensionality reduction with a dataset containing images of faces. Through computational modeling in Python, the dataset was transformed to smaller dimensions, graphically visualizing the reduction in variance. Additionally, recursive PCA was used to test whether the data could retain more variance in the same number of dimensions compared to regular PCA.
