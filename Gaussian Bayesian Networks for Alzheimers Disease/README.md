# Gaussian Bayesian Networks for Alzheimers Disease

This research focused on analyzing data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to explore relationships between different biomarkers and Alzheimer’s progression using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Gaussian Bayesian Networks. 

The objective was to examine how genetic factors (APOE4 gene) and neurotoxins (beta-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau) relate to cognitive decline and brain atrophy. The findings helped model the progression of the disease and provided insights into potential diagnostic markers.

The data used for this project should not be released along with this project, per the *ADNI data use agreement*.
