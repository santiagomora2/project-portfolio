  abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE4 homozygosity on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by examining its clinical, pathological and biomarker changes to see whether APOE4 homozygotes constitute a distinct, genetically determined form of AD. Data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and five large cohorts with AD biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis included 3,297 individuals for the pathological study and 10,039 for the clinical study. Findings revealed that almost all APOE4 homozygotes exhibited AD pathology and had significantly higher levels of AD biomarkers from age 55 compared to APOE3 homozygotes. By age 65, nearly all had abnormal amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and 75% had positive amyloid scans, with the prevalence of these markers increasing with age, indicating near-full penetrance of AD biology in APOE4 homozygotes. The age of symptom onset was earlier in APOE4 homozygotes at 65.1, with a narrower 95% prediction interval than APOE3 homozygotes. The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome. However, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes. The study concludes that APOE4 homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.},

abstract = {Summary
The simplest definition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a persistent and worsening memory loss with postmortem confirmation of the gold standard markers of amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain at autopsy. In 1984, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) differentiated between the clinical diagnosis of milder forms of the disease, referred to as “possible AD,” and more advanced cases as “probable AD.” The recent guideline by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) working group (2011) describes AD as having a gradual onset with continual deterioration in cognitive ability, progressing through a presymptomatic stage (preclinical AD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild AD to severe AD. Although it is hypothesized that the pathophysiologic changes associated with AD start one or more decades before the clinical manifestation of symptoms occurs, no single laboratory test is able to diagnose AD with high sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>90%). Diagnosis of AD is even less accurate for the early stages of the disease. Though AD has a specific clinical phenotype with pathological changes that can be confirmed in vivo using biomarkers according to the criteria set by International Working Group (IWG) (2014), use of these biomarkers is largely limited to the research setting and supporting to clinical diagnosis. Accurate clinical diagnosis of AD remains challenging because of the extended prodromal stages of AD, overlapping clinical features with other non-AD dementias, and multiple unclear molecular etiologies. In general, clinical diagnosis of AD by specialists is still made by excluding other neurological diseases, requiring a complete assessment that considers all possible causes through a series of clinical, psychometric, and brain scanning tests. This chapter describes the current approaches to the clinical diagnosis of AD, with a proposed comprehensive framework presented at the end of the chapter.}
