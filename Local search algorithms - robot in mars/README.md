# Local Search Algorithms - Robot on Mars [2024]

Local search algorithms (Greedy Search and Simulated Annealing) were used to simulate an exploration robot on Mars, aiming to reach the bottom of a crater while adhering to depth restrictions, so the robot could not descend more than 20 meters in a single step.

Upon comparison, Simulated Annealing was found to be more effective at finding global minima, while Greedy Search was better at finding local minima. For the purposes of this project, Simulated Annealing was more effective.
